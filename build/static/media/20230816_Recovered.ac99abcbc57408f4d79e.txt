There was a massive number lay off at the company I work for which kind of included me. 
I've seen people who worked in that company for 20+ years and thought this company will never just kick people out at least not within minutes of notice like I've seen in the movies.
But it happened. Within minutes I've lost people I worked with for last months. 
I'm grateful that they got another company to hire me and several other employees, but I was just sad to say goodbye to my friends. 
At the end of day, it is what it is. I've got to move on with my life. Always, don't forget my purpose of working. 
On to the next chapter :)
