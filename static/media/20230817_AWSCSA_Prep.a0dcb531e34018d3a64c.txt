I have heard that AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate and AWS Certified Developer - Associate share similar study material to AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner test.
Solutions Architect and Developer path are both quite interesting to as well, so to take my AWS skills to the next level, either one of those test will be a perfect fit for me. I just bought Neal Davis' Solutions Architect test prep package.
I'm aware of negative opinions regarding vendor license and how certificates don't represent 100% of the skills that a certain engineer got. 
As for my view of current job market, I think if you're an engineer who wants to make transition in your engineer career or promote from the current role, then those vendor license are better than nothinng.
For me, vendor license will only be used to grab HR's attention among thousands of application from other candidates.
