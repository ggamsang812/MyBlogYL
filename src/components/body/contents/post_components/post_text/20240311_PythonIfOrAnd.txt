Came across this problem on LeetCode: <a href='https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-vowels-in-a-substring-of-given-length/description/' target='_blank'>Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length</a>
Wasn't a tough problem to solve. Only thing I had look up was how to use OR operator in an IF-statement.
Basically, Python does behave like natural English, but this is one case where that abstraction fails and Python interpreter is more literal minded here.<pre><code class="language-py">if name == "Kevin" or "Jon" or "Inbar":
</code></pre>is logically equivalent to:<pre><code class="language-py">if (name == "Kevin") or ("Jon") or ("Inbar"):</code></pre>Which, for user Bob, is equivalent to:<pre><code class="language-py">if (False) or ("Jon") or ("Inbar"):</code></pre>The or operator chooses the first operand that is "truthy", i.e. which would satisfy an if condition (or the last one, if none of them are "truthy"):<pre><code class="language-py">if "Jon":</code></pre>Since "Jon" is truthy, the if block executes. That is what causes "Access granted" to be printed regardless of the name given.

My solution to above LeetCode problem in Python3 was:<pre><code class="language-py">class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        substr = ""
        total = 0        

        for index in range(len(s) - k + 1) :
            substr = s[index : index + k]
            num = substr.count("a") + substr.count("e") + substr.count("i") + substr.count("o") + substr.count("u")
            if total < num :
                total = num 

        return total
